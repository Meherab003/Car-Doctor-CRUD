# Mongo DB CRUD Operation

Mongo DB can be used with express js, which is built on Nodejs. I am currently learning MERN stack so JS is my go-to programming language.

﻿Mongo DB has a  npm package `﻿npm install mongodb` ﻿and I am currently using it.

##  CRUD:
C = Create `﻿app.post` 

R = Read `﻿app.get` 

U = Update `﻿app.put` / `﻿app.patch` 

D =  Delete `﻿app.delete` 

#You can filter your task by using the operators:

## MongoDB Operators:

`﻿$in` to search if the value is in an array;
